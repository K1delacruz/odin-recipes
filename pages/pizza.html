    <h2>Classic Margherita Pizza</h2>
    <p>The Classic Margherita Pizza is a simple yet elegant Neapolitan-style pizza. It is traditionally recognized for representing the colors of the Italian flag: green (fresh basil), white (fresh mozzarella), and red (tomato sauce). It features a thin crust, is baked at high heat, and is known for its fresh, balanced flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients & Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3><li>Dough</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All-Purpose o Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Water (Lukewarm)</li>
        <li>Dry Active Yeast</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li> 
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Dough</h4>
        <li>Activate the Yeast: In the lukewarm water, mix the yeast and a pinch of sugar (if using sugar). Let it sit until foamy (bubbly) for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Kneading: Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead for 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Rising: Lightly oil a bowl. Place the dough inside, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1.5 – 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Divide: Once risen, divide the dough into two (2) equal portions.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><li>Toppings</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pizza Sauce (Tomato Sauce)</li>
        <li>Fresh Mozzarella (sliced/diced)</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese (grated, optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <h4>Assembly and Topping</h4>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat the oven to its highest temperature (ideally, 250°C / 480°F or higher). If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
        <li>Roll out the Dough: Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten each dough portion into a 10-12 inch circle.</li>
        <li>Toppings: Transfer the dough to a baking sheet (or pizza peel). Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce, leaving the edges for the crust. Arrange the slices of fresh mozzarella.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><li>Baking</li></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bake: Carefully slide the pizza into the hot oven (onto the pizza stone/steel if using).</li>
        <li>Baking Time: Bake for 8–15 minutes, depending on your oven's heat, until the cheese is melted and slightly browned, and the crust is puffed up and crispy.</li>
        <li>Final Touches: Once cooked, remove the pizza. Gently drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil. Scatter the fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
