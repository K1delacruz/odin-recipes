    <h2>Classic Beef Cheeseburger</h2>
    <p>The Classic Beef Cheeseburger is a renowned American sandwich consisting of a seasoned, grilled or pan-fried beef patty topped with melted cheese (typically Cheddar or American), served inside a toasted hamburger bun, often accompanied by various toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, and favorite sauces.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients & Instructions</h2>

      <h3><li>Pattie (Meat)</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ground Beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio)</li>
          <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
          <li>Olive Oil (or neutral oil)</li>
          <li>Sliced Cheese (Cheddar or American)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3><li>Buns and Toppings</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hamburger Buns</li>
          <li>Lettuce Leaves</li>
          <li>Tomato</li>
          <li>Red Onion</li>
          <li>Dill Pickles (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3><li>Sauces</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ketchup, Mustard, Mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Preparing the Pattie</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Seasoning: In a medium bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Do not overmix the meat, as this will result in a tough burger.</li>
        <li>Divide: Divide the seasoned beef into four (4) equal portions.</li>
        <li>Form: Gently form each portion into a patty about 1 inch thick and slightly wider than your bun.</li>
        <li>Create a Dimple: Use your thumb to create a small indent (dimple) in the center of each patty. This prevents the burger from rounding up while cooking.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>Cooking</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat Pan/Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, or heat the olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>Cook/Grill: Place the patties on the hot grill or pan.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Medium Doneness: Cook for 4-5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Well-done: Cook for 6-7 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Do not press down on the burgers while cooking to keep the juices inside.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Cheese: During the last 1 minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Allow it to melt.</li>
          <li>Toast Buns: While the burgers rest briefly, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the grill or in the pan for about 1 minute.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3><li>Assembly and Serving</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sauce: Spread your chosen sauces (mayo, ketchup, mustard) on the inside of both the top and bottom bun halves.</li>
          <li>Assemble:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Place the Lettuce on the bottom bun.</li>
            <li>Add the Tomato and Red Onion slices.</li>
            <li>Place the Cheeseburger Patty.</li>
            <li>Add Dill Pickles (if using).</li>
            <li>Cover with the top bun.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Serve: Serve immediately while hot!</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
